# qtwm2

A window manager that isn't a qt, round two.

Forked from [mcwm](http://www.hack.org/mc/hacks/mcwm/). See mcwm's feature list [here](http://www.hack.org/mc/hacks/mcwm/features.html).

Notable changes:
---
* Removed `movelim`'s functionality so that you can move windows across monitors. 
* (Mostly) Moved all configuration to config.h. Command-line options are generally removed.
* Remove some keybinding elements.
